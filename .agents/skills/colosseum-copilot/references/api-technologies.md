# Technology analysis

V2 sign-in provides four `POST` routes under `/technologies`: `/counts`, `/co-usage`, `/trends`, and `/top`. They use recorded technology tags from public project repositories. They require `evidence:read` (or `copilot:retrieval`). The four routes share the analysis limit of 10 requests per minute and the per-user limit of two concurrent requests.

## Requests

A technology is `{ "category": "frameworks", "name": "Anchor" }`. The seven categories are `languages`, `frameworks`, `chains`, `protocols`, `services`, `tooling`, and `standards`. Names are trimmed and matched without case, but there is no alias or substring matching. Responses return lowercase names; use project details for display names. Matching uses the name only. The category you send is echoed back but doesn't narrow the match, so never add one name's counts across categories. `/top` and `/co-usage` list each name once under its most common category, and `technologyCategory` filters on that category. Find exact recorded names first with `POST /technologies/top` and `topK: 50`, omitting `technologyCategory`; use project details for display names. Do not guess names in a counts loop. Send technology requests one at a time, honor `Retry-After`, and treat a non-200 as missing data, never a zero count.

Each route accepts an optional `cohort`:

```json
{
  "hackathonSlugs": ["radar", "breakout"],
  "winnersOnly": true,
  "includeHonorableMentions": false,
  "categoryKeys": ["stablecoin-rails"]
}
```

Omitting `cohort` selects every project Copilot covers. `hackathonSlugs` accepts one to 20 slugs; `categoryKeys` accepts one to ten keys. Read `GET /categories` for the current keys. Set `includeSecondaryCategories: true` to include matches in a project's related second group. A `categoryKeys` filter returns `503 CATEGORIES_UNAVAILABLE` while category data is unavailable. `winnersOnly` defaults to `false`. When it is `true`, honorable mentions are excluded unless `includeHonorableMentions: true`. Using `includeHonorableMentions: true` without `winnersOnly: true` is invalid. Without a winner filter, honorable mentions remain ordinary projects. The category filter selects any listed key.

Requests reject unknown fields. Unknown technologies or hackathons return empty or zero results. For `/co-usage` and `/top`, `topK` defaults to 10 and accepts integers from 1 to 50. Overall counts and top-technology shares use all projects in the selected cohort, including projects without usable repository tags. Per-hackathon shares use that hackathon's selected projects. Each `/co-usage` result's `share` is its `count` divided by `totals.count`, the number of projects tagged with the input technology.

### Counts

`POST /technologies/counts`:

```json
{
  "technology": { "category": "frameworks", "name": "Anchor" },
  "cohort": { "winnersOnly": true }
}
```

The response has `technology`, `totals`, and `hackathons`. `totals` contains `projects` (permitted projects in the cohort), `projectsWithRepositoryTags` (projects with usable tags), `count` (distinct projects tagged with the technology), and `share` (`count / projects`, or zero for an empty cohort). Each `hackathons` entry has the same four numbers and `hackathon: { slug, name, startDate }`. `startDate` can be null. Entries run in hackathon date order, then slug; a selected hackathon with no matching projects has zero counts.

### Technologies used together

`POST /technologies/co-usage` accepts `technology`, optional `cohort`, and optional `topK`. It returns `technology`, `totals` as above, and `results`. Each result has `technology`, `count` (projects tagged with both technologies), `share` (`count / input technology count`), `cohortCount` (projects tagged with the other technology in the full cohort), and `lift` (`share / (cohortCount / projects)`). Lift compares co-usage with that other technology's cohort frequency. Results are ordered by co-usage count, then category and name. The input technology is omitted; no input matches gives an empty list.

### Trends

`POST /technologies/trends` accepts `technology` and optional `cohort`. It returns `technology` and the same ordered `hackathons` entries as `/counts`. Compare `projectsWithRepositoryTags` as well as `count` before interpreting a change in `share` as a change in adoption.

### Top technologies

`POST /technologies/top` accepts optional `cohort`, `technologyCategory`, and `topK`:

```json
{
  "cohort": { "hackathonSlugs": ["breakout"] },
  "technologyCategory": "services",
  "topK": 5
}
```

Omit `technologyCategory` to rank across all seven technology categories. The response has `totals: { projects, projectsWithRepositoryTags }` and `results: [{ technology: { category, name }, count, share }]`. Counts are per project; shares use all cohort projects. Results are ordered by count, then category and name. Multiple hackathons are combined; request each separately for separate rankings.

## Reading the results

These are counts of recorded repository tags among permitted projects, not proof of current deployment or use. Missing tags do not establish that a project uses none. Compare tag coverage across cohorts before interpreting shares or trends. For project names and source evidence, use `POST /search/projects` with an empty query and `filters.builtWith`, then open project details. A temporary `503 EVIDENCE_UNAVAILABLE` means repository technology data is temporarily unavailable; retry later and report those counts as unavailable. Tech-stack tags from project search are a looser measure that can differ materially; label them if you use them. `503 PROJECT_PERMISSIONS_UNAVAILABLE` is temporary; retry later.
